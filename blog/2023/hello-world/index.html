				<h1>hello world!</h1>
				<aside>published 15:47 UTC on September 15th, 2023</aside><br>
				<p>so, it's finally here, my very own blog, and it should be accessible all the way from the latest Android-powered kettle right down to the family DELL Dimension from the turn of the century, because why not?</p>
				<h3>what took so long ?</h3>
					<p>that is a gooood question. the answer is pretty straight forward: when i'm home, i'm busy with producing videos and streams! while i do get ideas for them all the time, side projects of mine such as the website and soafenTV are left to one side until i'm away from home, where i can't really work on videos or streams as much.</p>
					<p>so now that i'm finally away from home, i got cracking on the final roadblock that was stopping this blog from existingâ€“i do everything on this site by hand (...or paw), static site generators scare me, but i want to make my blog available over RSS!</p>
					<p>as it turns out, RSS is pretty trivial to manually write by <s>hand</s> PAW!!1 and a <a href="//moth.monster/blog/rssbyhand/">guide that i came across</a> from moth.monster was a very helpful resource to get me going ^^</p>
				<h3>what this blog is for</h3>
					<p>i plan to use this blog to house two things:
						<ul>
							<li>the first being general news and updates pertaining to myself and my site, and...</li>
							<li>the second will likely be tutorials and guides for how to do things that maybe aren't easy to find or well documented, if at all!</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>hopefully this will prove informative, helpful or at the very least interesting to someone else out there!</p>
					<p>well that's pretty much all i have to share for now, i don't exactly have a comments section planned, but if you'd like to get in touch you may do so through <a href="//soafen.love/contact">my contact page</a>.</p>
					<p>bye for now :3</p>
